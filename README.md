# CompareOffers
A simple python tool for comparing job offers between companies including support for assuming promotions over the years and simulating it

Released this tool at the request few people I was showing it to. The offer numbers are all completely made-up and chosen to illustrate the tool. Feel free to plug in your own offer numbers or information from levels.fyi to compare. 

The tool supports entering leveling information and assumptions on how long you will spend at each level. It takes into account a variety of different types of bonus vesting schedules and allows you to plot them side-by-side and see how much you will save taking into account those different vesting schedules and promotion levels assumptions

See [main.py](main.py) to set the assumptions and run that script to get the plots
